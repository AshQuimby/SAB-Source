# SAB-Source

  The source code for SAB.

  SAB is certainly a game.



  The executable jar runs anywhere on your computer for the most part without sound or mod support.

  If you run it through the SAB folder with the assets it might work with sounds and mods, depending on how you go about it.



  These are the two main things that we want to fix, yet we can't seem to find a way to do it. These are the struggles of using only the Java standard library with a     custom engine built from scratch.
  
# How To Play

  Navigate the menus using the arrow keys or WASD. Press ESCAPE or SHIFT to go back to the previous menu. Press ENTER to confirm your selection.
  
  Player One uses WASD to move and select a character, F to attack, and Z to parry. Player 2 uses the arrow keys to move and sele, M to attack, and B to parry.
  
  
  
  If you want to host a game online, you will need to have the correct port forwarded to let other players join.
  
  To join a game, type in the host's IP address and port and wait to connect. The server won't start the game until both players are connected, so being in the loading   screen for a few seconds is normal.
